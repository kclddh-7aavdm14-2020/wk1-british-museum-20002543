       <p>British Museum was built in 1753 and opened in Montagu House in 1759. It is the first public national museum in the world. The British Museum has lots of digital resources which are changing the way audiences and researchers work. They can easy and quick access to a wide range of material. As a British Museum respond to the challenge of ‘become digital’, meeting the information needs of online visitors is an important part for the museum. It is very important for researchers and museum professionals to explore its uses. The British Museum continues to be committed to making its collections accessible to as a wide a range of audiences as possible, both virtual and physics. The British Museum launched an online version of its collections database online.</p> 
       <p>In October 2007, the British Museum launched its online collection (COL), the Web version of its collections database. Starting with two-dimensional artworks (mainly on paper), the collection online project needs to be released in stages over a three-month period. A database of all British Museum collections records years as well as conservation and scientific records. By the end of 2009, the entire database of over 1,700,000 records, covering everything from archaeological, ethnographic and numismatic objects to prints, and spanning the widest range of history and culture, will be available to the public worldwide. The database is not yet complete, as the British Museum publishes on its website an extensive collection of information. However, what remains is mainly a large number of holdings of fragments and documentary prints (e.g. bookplates and merchandise cards), held in two parts for each department. Most of the departments' main collections have been recorded.</p>
